Hi, my name is Cody. I am a Software Engineering Resident and open-source contributor at Codesmith. I have built responsive web-applications with React on the frontend, Redux for managing state, Node and Express to handle backend requests, and Axios for API calls. I have modeled and integrated both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, as well as developed test cases using the Jest testing framework and React Testing Library. I am a co-creator of Deno DLM, a distributed locking manager for Deno. 

I have worked solo, as well as on teams that adhere to the principles and methodologies of scrum development. I have experience building projects from scratch and also iterating on previous code bases. I love to solve problems and overcome technical challenges. I am excited for the opportunity to grow as a software engineer.

Co-Creator of Deno-Redlock: a highly-available, Redis-based distributed systems lock manager for Deno with great safety and liveness guarantees.
