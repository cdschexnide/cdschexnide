Hi, my name is Cody. I'm interested in electronics and programming. I enjoy spending time in the rural areas of Kountze, Texas with animals. 
I'm currently studying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in preparation for the Codesmith cohort beginning on March 21, 2022. 
I have real interest in collaboration on a mobile application, although I haven't quite determined the specific application to pursue. 
I can be reached by phone at (409)-828-0274 or by email at codydschexnider@gmail.com.
